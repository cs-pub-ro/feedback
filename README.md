# Feedback Analsyis

These are scripts for automating the extraction, processing and presentation of feedback results from a [Moodle](https://moodle.org) instance. We use the [ACS UPB Moodle instance](https://acs.curs.pub.ro/) throughout the scripts. They can be adapted to a different Moodle instance.

The `retrieve-feedback` folder stores scripts and helper files for automatic retrieval of feedback results files. The `process-feedback` folder stores scripts and helper files for the automatic processing (i.e. getting stats) of feedback information from the retrieved feedback results files.
